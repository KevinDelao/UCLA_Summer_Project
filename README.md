# UCLA_Summer_Project
Will store the project code for the B.I.G summer internship 2020 project 
Our summer project involved determining the effectivnes of machine learning interpreters such as SHAP at detecting causal genotypes. Our project involved developing simulations of genetic data and utilizing machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Neural Networks to predict phenotypes using genotypes as features.

For the full documentation regarding our project please see Internship_Summer_Report.pdf for the full findings from our research.
