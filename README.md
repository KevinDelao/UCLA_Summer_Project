# UCLA_Summer_Project
Will store the project for the B.I.G internship summer project

# Project
## Data
Simulating genotype and phenotype data with 1 or 2 causal loci.

## Data Processsing
### Machine Learning Models
Using Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Neural Networks to predict the phenotype of the simulated genotypes.

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlainations)
Using SHAP to identify the causal loci by determining the feature with the most impact in LR, RFR and NN.
